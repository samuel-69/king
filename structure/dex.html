                <p>People access websites using 
                    software called a web browser. 
                    Popular examples include 
                Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, 
                Chrome, and Opera.In order to view a web page, 
                users might type a web address 
                into their browser, follow a 
                link from another site, or use a 
                bookmark.</p>
                <p>When you ask your browser for 
                    a web page, the request is sent 
                    across the Internet to a special 
                    computer known as a web 
                    server which hosts the website.
                    Web servers are special 
                    computers that are constantly 
                    connected to the Internet, and 
                    are optimized to send web pages 
                    out to people who request them.</p>
                    <ul class="sar">
                        <li>Some big companies run their 
                            own web servers, but it is more 
                            common to use the services of 
                            a web hosting company who 
                            charge a fee to host your site.</li>
                            <li>Screen readers are programs 
                                that read out the contents of a 
                                computer screen to a user. They 
                                are commonly used by people 
                                with visual impairments.</li>

            <p>Think about the stories you 
                read in a newspaper: for each 
                story, there will be a headline, 
                some text, and possibly some 
                images. If the article is a long 
                piece, there may be subheadings 
                that split the story into separate 
                sections or quotes from those 
                involved. Structure helps readers 
                understand the stories in the 
                newspaper.</p>

            <header>text</header>
            <p>When creating a web page, you add tags 
                (known as markup) to the contents of the 
                page. These tags provide extra meaning 
                and allow browsers to show users the 
                appropriate structure for the page.</p>
                <p>In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that 
                    appears on your pages. You will learn about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
                        describe both headings and paragraphs</li>
                    <li>Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such 
                        as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
                        you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
                        meaning of acronyms, and so on</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Browsers display the contents of 
                headings at different sizes. The 
                contents of an <h1> element is 
                the largest, and the contents of 
                an <h6> element is the smallest. 
                The exact size at which each 
                browser shows the headings 
                can vary slightly.</p>
            <p> Users can also 
                adjust the size of text in their 
                browser. You will see how to 
                control the size of text, its color, 
                and the fonts used when we 
                come to look at CSS.</p>

            <header>lists</header>
            <ul>

                <p>There are lots of occasions when we 
                    need to use lists. HTML provides us with 
                    three different types:</p>
                    <li>Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is 
                        numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
                        a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
                        where each point needs to be identified by a section 
                        number.</li>
                        <li>Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point 
                            (rather than characters that indicate order).</li>
                        <li>Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the 
                            definitions for each of those terms.</li>

                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>

        <section>
            <header>links</header>
            <p>Links are the defining feature of the web 
                because they allow you to move from 
                one web page to another â€” enabling the 
                very idea of browsing or surfing.</p>
                <ul>

                    <p>You will commonly come across the following types of links:</p>
                    <li>Links from one website to another</li>
                    <li>Links from one page to another on the same website </li>
                    <li> Links from one part of a web page to another part of the 
                        same page</li>
                    <li>Links that open in a new browser window</li>
                    <li>Links that start up your email program and address a new 
                        email to someone</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything 
                between the opening a tag and the closing a tag. You specify 
                which page you want to link to using the href attribute.</p>
            <p></p>

        <section>
            <header id="images">images</header>
            <p>There are many reasons why you might 
                want to add an image to a web page: you 
                might want to include a logo, photograph, 
                illustration, diagram, or chart.</p>
            <p>There are several things to consider when selecting and 
                preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them 
                right will make it look more attractive and professional.</p>
            <p>A picture can say a thousand words, and great 
                images help make the difference between an 
                average-looking site and a really engaging one.</p>
            <p>If you are building a site from scratch, it is good 
                practice to create a folder for all of the images 
                the site uses.</p>

        <section>
            <header>forms</header>
            <p>Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred 
                to a printed document that contains 
                spaces for you to fill in information.
                HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different 
                elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to 
                your site.
                Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or 
                you need to create more complicated insurance applications, 
                HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from 
                your users.</p>
                <p>The best known form on the web is probably 
                    the search box that sits right in the middle of 
                    Google's homepage.</p>
